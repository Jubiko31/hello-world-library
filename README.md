# Hello World Library  🐱‍🏍 

This project is part of my "Hello World Dictioanry" project.
Here will be represented "Hello World" program in all programming languages. And how to run them using Terminal (in comments).

This is just for fun, so do not take it seriously :), obviosly I do not know all of the languages, but still you can checkout my projects on porfolio.
